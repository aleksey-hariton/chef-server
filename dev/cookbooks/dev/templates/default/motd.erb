DVM QuickStart
---------------
1. In your active shell (this one!) use "sudo -i" to gain root. dvm needs it.
2. To load the chef-server repo's erchef project and run it in the active shell:
    # dvm load oc_erchef
    # dvm start oc_erchef
3. To load the things you'll usually want - erchef, pedant, chef server configuration cookbooks:
    # dvm load omnibus server-ctl-cookbooks
    # dvm load oc-chef-pedant
    # dvm load oc_erchef
    # dvm start oc_erchef
4. To run the chef-server repo's oc-chef-pedant suite:
    # dvm run oc-chef-pedant [--pedant-flags,...]
5. To start a psql session with a project's database, use:
    # dvm psql $PROJECT

Use dvm list for a list of loadable projects, and dvm list $PROJECT for a list of loadable deps.
For a lot more information about dvm see chef-server/dev/README.md

Loaded erlang projects will automatically hot-load your changes.  Save source files
on the host and they'll compile and load within a few seconds.
